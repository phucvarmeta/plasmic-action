# Usage

See <https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/codegen-guide/> for the full docs to get started with SuiNova codegen.

`plasmic init` creates the initial plasmic.json file, pointing to your local dev host.

`plasmic sync --projects ...` allows you to sync all components in the specified projects
down as code files to your current folder. Once you've run `plasmic init`, you can run
`plasmic sync` from any subfolder of the folder with the `plasmic.json` file.
